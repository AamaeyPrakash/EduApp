      "Example": "The product of three numbers in A.P. is 224, and the largest number is 7 times the smallest. Find the numbers.",
      "Solution": "Let the numbers be $a-d$, a, and $a+d$. Then, $a(a^2-d^2)=224$ and $a+d = 7(a-d)$. Solving gives a = 8 and d = 6, so the numbers are 2, 8, and 14.",

      "Solution": "For three numbers to be in A.P., the difference between consecutive terms must be equal. A short calculation shows the condition reduces to $x+z = 2y$, which holds since $x, y, z$ are in A.P.",
